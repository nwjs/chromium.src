// Auctions have two phases, with phase transitions handled by the owner. All

// * Loading interest groups phase: This loads interest groups that can

// this phase before advancing to the next ensures that if any auctions share
// bidder worklets, they'll all be loaded together, and only send out a single
// trusted bidding signals request.

// * Bidding/scoring phase: This phase loads bidder and seller worklets,
// generates bids, scores bids, and the highest scoring bid for each component
// auction is passed to its parent auction, which also scores it. When this
// phase completes, the winner will have been decided.
