// Base class of per-StoragePartition manager of auction bidder and seller
// worklet processes. This provides limiting and sharing of worker processes.
//
// AuctionProcessManager managers two types of processes, idle processes, and
// non-idle processes.
//
// Idle processes are owned directly by AuctionProcessManager::idle_processes_,
// and have no associated ProcessHandle -- they have a WorkletProcess only. On
// process crash or idle timeout, they tell the AuctionProcessManager to destroy
// them.
//
// Non-idle processes have been handed out to one or more live ProcessHandles,
// and are tracked in one of the AuctionProcessManager's ProcessMap with
// raw pointers. When the last ProcessHandle releases a reference to the
// WorkletProcess, it's destroyed, and informs the AuctionProcessManager to
// remove it from the map. On process crash, it may also be removed from the
// map, to prevent reuse, even though consumers may still own references to it.

  // processes will be created for bidder worklets, though new bidder worklet

  // kMaxBidderProcesses because sellers behave a bit differently - they're
