caption: Device screensaver image source.
desc: |-
  Configures the list of images to display in the screensaver for the sign-in screen.

  Each list item references an image to be displayed in the screensaver. The item must have as members a URL to the image, and the SHA-256 hash value of the image file for verification. The image format must be JPEG. The <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> device will download these images, and maintain a local cache of these references.

  This policy will not have any effect if the <ph name="DEVICE_SCREENSAVER_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DeviceScreensaverEnabled</ph> policy is set to false.

  If this policy is unset, or the list does not contain any valid image references, the screensaver for the sign-in screen will not be displayed, regardless of the value set in the <ph name="DEVICE_SCREENSAVER_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">DeviceScreensaverEnabled</ph> policy.
