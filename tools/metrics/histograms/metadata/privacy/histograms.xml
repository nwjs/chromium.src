    The number of sites that may have had their storage cleared by DIPS.

    If DIPS deletion is on, this is the number of sites that have had storage
    cleared by DIPS. Otherwise, this number is the sites that would've had their
    storage cleared if the DIPS deletion feature was on.

    This is recorded every time the DIPS timer is fired, which is determined by
    the `timer_delay` parameter of the DIPS feature.

    This is only logged for site-data clearing that occurs as a result of DIPS.
    If a site contributes to this count then it has performed a potential
    tracking action (e.g. writing to storage, bouncing the user, or both)
    without the user interacting with that site before, or soon after, the
    action.

  <summary>
    Records the validity of budget entries read from disk. Recorded once every
    time that budget is attempted to be consumed to reflect the state of stored
    budget data for the requested origin and API. If multiple errors are found,
    only the first encountered/detected is reported. As a result, reported
    errors will be skewed in favor of checks performed first, but we expect
    multiple instances of corruption for budget entries on disk to be rare.

    Records the result of a request to consume budget for the Private

    (but not each individual histogram contribution).

    Records the initialization statuses of PrivateAggregationBudgetStorage,
    indicating whether it was successful and, if not, why it failed. Recorded
    when the initialization reply callback is run on the main sequence.

    Records whether PrivateAggregationBudgetStorage has already been shut down
    when the initialization finishes (i.e. the reply callback is run on the main

  <summary>
    Records whether a call to PrivateAggregationHost::SendHistogramReport()
    successfully resulted in the report request being forwarded to the manager
    and, if not, the reason for failure. Further, breaks out the case of too
    many contributions, where the request is forwarded but is truncated. Note
    that, even if successfully forwarded, the report may still be rejected by
    the budgeter or in the aggregation_service layer. Recorded for every call.
