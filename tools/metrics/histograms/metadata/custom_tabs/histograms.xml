    Android: Duration in milliseconds of a custom tab session (between onResume
    and onPause). This is logged for the sessions closed automatically without
    user intervention. Sessions closed by user input (back press/close button)
    will not be logged.

    Note that there can be user inputs that go undetected by the logic. So the
    histogram can contain false positives i.e. session closed by user but
    regarded as auto-closed.

    Android: This histogram is used as a means to count the total instances of
    Incognito custom tabs created meanwhile binning them across launching first
    party apps.

    The launching first party apps are inferred by the package name they
    provided when creating a custom tab connection and if we can't infer via
    package name then as a fallback we rely on them declaring
    EXTRA_APPLICATION_ID when launching Incognito custom tabs. If both fails,
    then the launch is recorded in the Others entry.

  <summary>
    Android only. Recorded during Partial Custom Tab creation, if it has not
    already been logged during the existing Chrome session. Returns true if the
    value for &quot;immersive_mode_confirmations&quot; from Settings.Secure is
    set to &quot;confirmed&quot;, false otherwise.

    This is trying to approximate what percentage of Chrome sessions that run
    PCCTs have already confirmed the dialog that shows up when an app enters
    immersive mode (e.g. when hiding the navigation bar buttons or status bar).
    Once the user has tapped on the dialog, it should never be displayed again.
    This metric will be used to measure the impact that hiding the navigation
    bar buttons would have. In the scenario where we hide the nav bar buttons
    only when a PCCT is being resized, this confirmation dialog shows only while
    the user is dragging the PCCT window, but disappears as soon as the finger
    is lifted from the screen, giving no time for the user to confirm that they
    are aware that they entered immersive mode.

    A CCT can be defined as retainable if 1) it is launching with the same URL

    taskId and package name. The package name identifier to use will depend on

  <summary>
    Recorded only for Android. Record information about the state of the client
    app, custom tab and system in the moment the connection between the client
    and the custom tab is terminated. With this, we are trying to understand how
    often a connection is terminated (the client app dies/is killed/is closed)
    while a custom tab is in foreground. Also, if the EXTRA_KEEP_ALIVE is set,
    we want to understand if it reduces the number of connections being
    terminated. The aim is that CT_FOREGROUND and CT_FOREGROUND_KEEPALIVE are
    logged as little as possible, while the rest of the states are expected ways
    in which a connection may be terminated.

    *CT_FOREGROUND*/*CT_BACKGROUND* - an enum value that contains this text
    reflects if the custom tab was in the foreground/background when the
    connection was terminated.

    *KEEP_ALIVE* - an enum value that contains this text reflects that the
    EXTRA_KEEP_ALIVE intent extra was specified and that the custom tab binds to
    the service provided by it in order to increase the priority of the client
    app to foreground.

    *LOW_MEMORY* - an enum value that contains this text reflects that the
    system was low on memory when the connection was terminated. This does not
    mean that this was indeed the reason for the connection being terminated,
    but it might be a good indicator of it.

    UNKNOWN - if this is logged then there is probably a bug in the code as we
    have a state we can be in that we don't currently account for.

    Recorded only for Android. Records the number of unique tabs open in the
    current custom tab session, when a new tab is opened. The count of this
    histogram includes the initial tab being opened, and can be recorded more
    than once in the same session.

    Do not record nor increase the count when switching into the previous tab
    (e.g. create new tab, close, and land onto an existing tab).

  <summary>
    Recorded only for Android. Records on every metrics upload whether the
    currently visible tab is a custom tab. The custom tab is launched by a
    client app with customized UI. Some metrics like page load time will behave
    differently for these tabs since it will be possible to warm up the browser
    process and prepare resources for specific urls ahead of time via a service
    connection. This histogram can be used to cluster these metric differently.

    As of M87, this histogram is logged on a log start, rather than log end to
    tag more logs.
