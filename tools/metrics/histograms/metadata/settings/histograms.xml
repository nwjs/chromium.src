<histogram name="Settings.SearchPageMatchCount" units="units"

  <owner>dschuyler@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The number of search page hits within the chrome://settings page. This is
    especially important when the count is zero (i.e. we returned no hits for a
    given search in settings). A search is considered complete via timeout since
    there is no concrete way to define the end of a search (the search is
    incremental).

  <summary>
    If there is no further activity in the search box for 1 second, this records
    one tick each time a settings section is shown as a result of searching
    withing the chrome://settings page. If multiple matches are found within the
    same section, the section match is only recorded once.

  <owner>dschuyler@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The number of search subpage hits within the chrome://settings page. This is
    different from Settings.SearchPageMatchCount in that it is tracking hits in
    subpages rather than top level pages. See also
    Settings.SearchPageMatchCount.
