    Logged on each UMA upload to represent which user-controllable Efficiency
    Mode setting the browser is in during the reported window. If the mode was
    changed between uploads, MIXED will be reported for that interval.

    This histogram is used internally to filter other histograms by efficiency
    mode.

    Logged every time V8DetailedMemoryReporter.GetV8MemoryUsage is sent to a
    renderer, with the measurement mode. This can be used to find the volume of
    measurement requests to track their performance overhead.
