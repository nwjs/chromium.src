  #
  # N.B. generally, embedders should look at this GN arg and at the

  # source at all (pulling the component in via GN, including headers,

  # and unconditionally using PA, but such a setup is inadvisable.

  # 1.  On Cronet bots, because Cronet doesn't use PartitionAlloc at all,
  #     and doesn't wish to incur the library size increase (crbug.com/674570).
