Description:
WebP is an image format that does both lossy and lossless compression of
digital photographic images. WebP consists of a codec based on VP8, that Google
open-sourced in May 2010 and a container based on RIFF. Website managers, web
developers and browser developers can use WebP to compress, archive and
distribute digital images more efficiently.
