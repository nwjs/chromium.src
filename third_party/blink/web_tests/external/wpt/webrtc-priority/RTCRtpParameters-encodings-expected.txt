This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL sender.getParameters() should return sendEncodings set by addTransceiver() promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: getFirstEncoding is not defined"
PASS setParameters() with modified encoding.active should succeed with RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with modified encoding.active should succeed without RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with modified encoding.priority should succeed with RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with modified encoding.priority should succeed without RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with modified encoding.networkPriority should succeed with RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with modified encoding.networkPriority should succeed without RTCRtpTransceiverInit
Harness: the test ran to completion.
