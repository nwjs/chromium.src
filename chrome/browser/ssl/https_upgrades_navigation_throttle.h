// HttpsUpgradesNavigationThrottle is responsible for observing HTTPS-First Mode
// navigations that have been upgraded by HttpsUpgradesInterceptor, timing them
// out if they take too long, and handling failure by triggering fallback
// navigations to HTTP and triggering the HTTPS-First Mode interstitial.
//
// Metadata about the navigation state (as it pertains to HTTPS-First Mode)
// shared between HttpsUpgradesInterceptor and HttpsUpgradesNavigationThrottle
// is stored in an HttpsOnlyModeTabHelper set as user-data on the WebContents in
// which the navigation occurs. (Such metadata might ordinarily be added to
// ChromeNavigationUIData, but the Interceptor only receives a clone of the
// data, so it can't be used as a channel between these classes.)
