// By default, the contentView does not occupy the full size of a framed
// window. Chrome still wants to draw in the title bar. Historically, Chrome
// has done this by adding subviews directly to the root view. This causes
// several problems. The most egregious is related to layer ordering when the
// root view does not have a layer. By giving the contentView the same size as
// the window, there is no longer any need to add subviews to the root view.
//
// If the window does not have a titlebar, then its contentView already has the
// same size as the window. In this case, this class has no effect.
//
// This class currently does not support changing the window's style after the
// window has been initialized.
